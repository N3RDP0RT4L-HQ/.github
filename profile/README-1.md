### N3RDP0RT4L HQ

Welcome to the N3RDP0RT4L headquarters operating on the planet Kepler-186F!

We have achieved many application ports, and modifications to make the SM-T380, and the in-progress codename "enuma" better then ever before.

We also hope you can all stick around for the exciting future of the inclusive N3RDP0RT4L scene.

- ⌨️ The first SM-T380 working LineageOS build has been released.
- 📫 I'm a **HUGE** Linux user! DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE DECADE OF MY VOYAGE!
