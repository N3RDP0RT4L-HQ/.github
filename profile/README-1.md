### N3RDP0RT4L HQ

Welcome to the N3RDP0RT4L headquarters operating on the planet Kepler-186F!

We have achieved many application ports, and modifications to make the SM-T380, and the in-progress codename "enuma" better then ever before.

We also hope you can all stick around for the exciting future of the inclusive N3RDP0RT4L scene.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently preparing something.
- ðŸ“« I'm a **HUGE** Linux user! DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE DECADE OF MY VOYAGE!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm stubborn (whoops !).
